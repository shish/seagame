seagame.erl:
	TCP front-end, for each incoming TCP connection:
		spawns a client handler process
		read TCP data and translate it into {command, paramater} tuples for the client

	TODO: HTTP front-end, for each HTTP request:
		if the request has no session ID cookie, generate one
		look up the client handler for that ID
		turn the request into a {command, paramater} tuple and send that to the client handler

client.erl:
	client handler process, accepts {command, paramater} tuples, checks them for validity
	and interacts with the rest of the system on the client's behalf
